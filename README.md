‚ÑπÔ∏è Fill the board with tessellating jelly-ominoes to earn points. 

‚ÑπÔ∏è Control the descent of each piece and its rotation to line them up perfectly.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keep an eye on the Jiggleometer - pieces must be settled to get deleted!

‚ÑπÔ∏è if a piece goes over the top, it's game over. Clear pieces by filling rows, and keeping the Jiggleometer low!

Play now on Linux üêß, macOS üçé, Windows ü™ü, and Android ü§ñ

### Settings

#### Desktop

- By pressing the menu button (three stacked rounded boxes, or the word menu) you may rebind all keys however you wish.
- On Linux and Windows a file ```settings.json``` contains key-bindings and a tutorial completion flag. These may be edited.
- On macOS the settings are stored in ```~Library/Application Support/app.jerboa.jellycram/settings.json```

#### Android

- By pressing the menu button (three stacked rounded boxes, or the word menu) you may invert tap and swipe controls and use the screen or object centric controls.
- In screen centric (not inverted) tapping below the middle pushes up. In object centric tapping below the *current piece* pushes up instead.

### Signing/Verifying your Download

The Android build is code-signed, with the same key as used on the Google Play store.

The desktop code is **signed with GPG**, and **md5sums are provided**. However for macOS and Windows additional signing is required for Smart Screen and macOS GateKeeper, which is as yet not planned (costs $100's/year)

#### Windows SmartScreen/User Access Control - "Unkown publisher"

- The code is not yet signed for Windows, you may run by ```left-click``` ```run anyway```. You may need to click ```more info```

#### macOS - "Unidentified developer"

- The code is not yet signed for macOS, you may run by ```control-click`` ```open```, and selecting ```open``` in the pop up. You may have to ```control-click`` ```open``` twice.


#### GPG keys

The games key is hosted on keyserver.ubuntu.com, you may obtain it in gpg like so:

```gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com -v --recv-keys 18e4f6b191de23e7978be4b46534065e085babba```

You should see something like:

```
gpg: pub  rsa3072/6534065E085BABBA 2024-01-26  Jerboa-app (JellyCram) <dev@jerboa.app>
gpg: key 6534065E085BABBA: "Jerboa-app (JellyCram) <dev@jerboa.app>" ...
...
```

#### Ways to verify

The files (executable and packed scripts) are provided with md5sums, and GPG signatures. The md5sums are contained within the file ```JellyCram.md5```

On linux or macOS you may verify as follows

- Check md5sum ```md5sum JellyCram```
- Check GPG ```gpg --verify JellyCram.sig```

To install md5sum on macOS with [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/md5sha1sum) ```brew install md5sha1sum```

On windows 

- Check md5sum ```md5sum JellyCram.exe```
- Check GPG ```gpg --verify JellyCram.exe.sig```
